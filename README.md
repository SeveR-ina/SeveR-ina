In Dec, 2019 I created an idea for a mobile app in the dating category. It's called Jivys: https://www.jivys.com/. This app gives you an opportunity to share your interests and goals with different people around the world and find those people who like the same things. You see these profiles, like them, chat with people. So after creating an idea, I drew prototypes for every mobile screen and also for website pages, I found designers, and remote native developers and tested many builds.
